# Workshops — Registration & Ticketing

Web app for **Beyond Guidance, a unit of Islamic Information Centre**, built by
**Al-Majeed School of Research Methodology & Innovation**.

Paste ordinary text — a promotional poster, or the WhatsApp registration replies
your team collects — and it is parsed into structured records, reviewed on
screen, stored in Firestore, and turned into tickets, receipts and spreadsheets.

- **Hosting / database:** Firebase Hosting + Cloud Firestore
- **Target domain:** `workshops.almajeedgroup.in`
- **Access:** email + password, administrators only. No self sign-up.
- **Parsing:** rule-based — no AI, no network calls, nothing leaves the browser

## 1. What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Import** | Paste the poster (emoji and all) or labelled text; review the parsed result; save. |
| **Register** | Paste WhatsApp replies in the `*Name:* …` format — as many as you like at once. |
| **Ticket** | Every registrant gets a sequential Ticket ID and a printable ticket + IIC payment receipt. |
| **Send** | One click opens WhatsApp or email with the ticket already written out. |
| **Contact** | Call or email any registrant directly from the list. |
| **Payments** | Mark Paid / Pending / Waived / Refunded inline; running totals and amount collected. |
| **Seats** | Seat limit tracked, with a warning when it is reached or exceeded. |
| **Export** | Excel, CSV, printable PDF — for all workshops, one workshop, or its registrations. |

## 2. Data model

```
workshops/{workshopId}
    title, code, ticketPrefix, startDate, endDate, time, durationHours,
    mode, venue, presentedBy, collaborators, resourcePersons[],
    coordinators[], audience, seatLimit, feeAmount, contactNumbers[],
    topics, outcome,
    lastTicketSeq, searchText, createdAt, updatedAt

    registrations/{registrationId}
        name, dob, qualification, courseName, whatsapp, area, email,
        paymentStatus, amountPaid, paymentMode, paymentRef,
        ticketId, notes, nameLower, searchText

admins/{uid}            <- the access allow-list, managed from the Console
```

**Everything is generated from [`src/lib/schema.js`](src/lib/schema.js)** — the
parser, the forms, the table columns, the Excel sheets, the ticket and the
receipt. To add, rename or remove a field, edit that one file.

Organisation names, phone numbers and the currency symbol live in the `ISSUER`
block at the top of the same file.

### Ticket IDs

`PREFIX-001`, `PREFIX-002`, … The prefix comes from the workshop's
**Ticket ID Prefix** field, or its code, or initials of the title plus the year
(`AI Hands-On Workshop` starting 2026 → `AIHOW26`).

Numbers are allocated inside a Firestore transaction against
`lastTicketSeq` on the workshop, so two people importing at the same moment can
never be handed the same number.

## 3. First-time setup

### 3.1 Create the Firebase project

1. <https://console.firebase.google.com> → **Add project**.
2. **Build → Firestore Database → Create database** → *Production mode* →
   location `asia-south1`.
3. **Build → Authentication → Get started → Email/Password → Enable.**
4. **Project settings → General → Your apps → Web (`</>`)** → register an app
   and copy the `firebaseConfig` values.

### 3.2 Configure

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste in those values. Put your project ID
into `.firebaserc`, replacing `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`.

> These config values are **not secret** — they ship inside the browser bundle
> by design. Security comes from the Firestore rules, not from hiding them.

### 3.3 Install and run

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3.4 Create the owner account

Signing in is *not* the same as being authorised. Firebase's Email/Password
provider lets anyone holding the public API key create an account, so the app
checks two things instead: is this the permanent owner account, or does a
document exist at `admins/{uid}`?

The owner account is **`almajeed.work@gmail.com`**, defined as
`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` in `src/lib/schema.js` **and** in `firestore.rules`.
Both copies must match — the rules file cannot import from JavaScript.

**Register that address before or immediately after deploying the rules:**

1. **Authentication → Users → Add user** → `almajeed.work@gmail.com` + a password.

That's all. On its first sign-in the app writes its own record into the
`admins` collection automatically, so the owner appears in the administrator
list without anyone copying a UID by hand. Access does not depend on that
write succeeding — the rules grant the owner access either way.

> Until that address is registered, the email is unclaimed. Anyone who knew the
> rule could register it and inherit administrator access, so do this first.

### 3.5 Add other administrators

1. **Authentication → Users → Add user** — their email and password.
2. Copy the generated **User UID**.
3. **Firestore → Start collection** → ID `admins` → document ID = that UID →
   fields `email` and `name`.

To revoke access, delete their `admins` document. (The owner account is not
revocable this way — change `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` in both files and redeploy.)

---

## 4. Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

That runs `vite build` and deploys both the Firestore rules and the site.
First time only, run `firebase login` before it.

### Connect `workshops.almajeedgroup.in`

1. **Hosting → Add custom domain** → `workshops.almajeedgroup.in`.
2. Add the **TXT** record Firebase shows, at your DNS provider for
   `almajeedgroup.in`.
3. Once verified, add the two **A** records it gives you, on the host
   `workshops`.
4. SSL is issued automatically; allow up to 24 hours.

## 5. What the parser understands

| Input | Example |
|---|---|
| `Label: value` | `Venue: Kabir Independent PU College` |
| WhatsApp bold labels | `*Name:* Ayesha Siddiqua` |
| `Label - value` | `Topic - Academic Writing` |
| label with no separator | `held on 03/09/2025` |
| **poster emoji** | 📅 date · ⏰ time · 📍 venue · 💰 fee · 🎓 eligibility · 📱 contact · ⚠️ seat limit |
| date ranges | `15th – 22nd August 2026` fills start **and** end |
| date formats | `03/09/2025`, `May 12, 2025`, `2026-08-15` |
| registration blocks | the `*Name:* / *DoB:* / …` reply format, repeated per candidate |
| registration tables | tab, pipe, comma or wide-space separated, with or without a header row |
| headerless rows | email, phone and date-of-birth are found by pattern wherever they sit |
| several workshops | separated by `---`, or a repeated `Title:` line |

Dates are read **day-first** (`03/09/2025` = 3 September), matching Indian
convention.

**If a label isn't recognised**, the review screen lists it under "Unmatched
labels". Add that spelling to the `aliases` array for the right field in
`src/lib/schema.js` and it will be picked up from then on.

## 6. Sending tickets

The ticket page gives you three routes:

- **Send on WhatsApp** — opens WhatsApp (app or web) with the full ticket and
  receipt already written into the message box. Review, then send.
- **Send by email** — opens your mail client with the subject and body filled in.
- **Print / Save as PDF** — produces the formatted ticket on one page; attach
  the saved PDF if you want a document rather than text.

Unpaid registrants get a **payment reminder** message from the WhatsApp button
on the list instead of a ticket.

### Note on automation

Sending happens through *your* WhatsApp and *your* mail client — the app never
sends on its own. Fully automated delivery (a ticket emailed the instant someone
registers) would need Cloud Functions on the Blaze plan plus an email provider
such as SendGrid, and the WhatsApp Business API for messages. The ticket text
and PDF are already generated by shared code (`src/lib/tickets.js`,
`src/components/TicketDocument.jsx`), so that can be added later without
reworking anything.

### Note on ticket links

Ticket pages are behind the admin login, so the link is not shareable with
students — the ticket travels as text or PDF. Making tickets publicly viewable
would mean allowing unauthenticated `get` on registration documents (their
20-character random IDs act as the secret). That is a deliberate privacy
trade-off; ask before enabling it.

## 7. Project layout

```
src/
  lib/schema.js            field + organisation definitions — THE file to edit
  lib/parser.js            text -> structured records
  lib/tickets.js           ticket IDs, share links, ticket & receipt text
  lib/db.js                Firestore reads/writes, ticket-ID allocation
  lib/exporters.js         Excel + CSV (loaded on demand)
  components/              WorkshopForm, RegistrationEditor,
                           RegistrationList, TicketDocument
  pages/                   Login, List, Import, Workshop, Edit, Ticket
  AuthContext.jsx          sign-in + admin allow-list check
  styles.css               all styling; monochrome only
firestore.rules            access control
```

## 8. Notes

- Search and filtering happen on the client, so no composite Firestore indexes
  are needed. Comfortable into the low thousands of records.
- Editing a workshop makes its registration list match the screen exactly —
  rows deleted there are deleted from the database. Existing ticket IDs are
  preserved.
- Deleting a workshop also deletes its registrations.
- Phone numbers are normalised to `+91` when a bare 10-digit number is given.
